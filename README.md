WebView App 2 with Kotlin

An Android App in Kotlin to create a WebWiew to display a Web Page.

Inject Kotlin's functions in JavaScript with / without the same name as another JS function.

Re-assign the variable jObj containing a Window Object with a Kotlin's Object name (in String) by putting it under pre-defined ECMA6 function : eval() during assignment to make name (a String) into a String Template.

Use the newly obtained jObj to check whether the page is loaded in the App or Not.

Also, override target JS function's call with Kotlin function with jObj (for functions with same name) when opened on this App.
